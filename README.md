# RandomTalkAgent
This is a sample agent code and server runtime repository for the Natural Language Division of the AIWolf contest series.
The previous task in 2019 was held as the AIWolfDial shared task, which is held as part of the AIWolfDial2019 workshop, collocated with the INLG conference.
See https://aiwolfdial.kanolab.net/ for details of the 2019 shared task and the workshop.
We will update this page to include the 2020 shared task information.

Clone the repository into your Eclipse workspace, then run the AutoStarter class as your main class:
https://github.com/aiwolfdial/RandomTalkAgent/blob/master/src/org/aiwolf/ui/bin/AutoStarter.java

By default, this class will run a server and connect five RandamTalkAgents.

You can change the behaviour by editing the .ini file:
https://github.com/aiwolfdial/RandomTalkAgent/blob/master/res/AutoStarter.ini

When you wish to connect your agent to a remote server, please change as
network=true
in the .ini file above. The server location is currently
host: "160.16.83.206"
port: 10001
